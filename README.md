# Suggested Improvements

## 1. Data Structure Optimization

I would improve how the data is structured, making it more efficient for manipulation and filtering, ensuring better performance in the interface.

---

## 2. Adding Responsiveness

I would implement a fully responsive design to ensure that the interface works well across different screen sizes, including mobile devices.

---

## 3. Improvement in Componentization

I would break down the page functionalities into smaller, more cohesive components, making the code more readable, reusable, and easier to maintain.

---

## 4. Creating a Modal for Image Editing

I would create a modal to allow image editing for components. This feature was not prioritized due to the absence of design and a file upload endpoint.
